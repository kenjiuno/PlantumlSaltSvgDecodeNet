# PlantumlSaltSvgDecodeNet

PlantumlSaltSvgDecodeNet will decode `<image>` tags which contain base64 encoded content of the type `svg+xml`.

This kind of svg files are limitedly generated by plantuml. e.g. use salt figures inside activity diagram.

It is still valid svg document, however rare vector graphics edtiors support *reuse* this kind of svg files. e.g. copy text from UI components.

So a kind of *decomposition* is required at the post process of UI designing.
